# Gif-Button-Maker

## In this project, I made a GIF button maker. 
### I used Bootstrap to make the webpage and the Giphy API to make it possible to get the GIFS.

**How it works**
#### When you search a gif in the search bar it pings the Giphy API and dymnamically creates a button with whatever you imputed on top of the page (mine is Anime themed but you can search whatever). When you click the button it will respond with 10 gifs of the imputed search. The gifs are still, but when you click on them they will animate. They also have a rating of G - R depending on what you search.

###Thanks for looking I hope you enjoyed it!
